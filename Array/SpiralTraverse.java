    Write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (that can be square-shaped when n == m) and 
    returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in spiral order. 
    Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes to the right, 
    and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited. 
    Sample Input 
        = [ 
            [1, 2, 3, 4], 
            [12, 13, 14, 5], 
            [11, 16, 15, 6], 
            [10, 9, 8, 7], 
    Sample Output = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
